We recently received a letter from Mr. Rayno's insurance company that I will attach if I can.
If you would please call Khris 603-339- 2437(owner), as he has all the details. We do not feel that we are liable for this, as it was a block foundation that was obviously unstable unbenounced to anyone (the home had also just undergone a home inspection, as I believe the owners just bought the home this summer). We did not touch the footing or anything that would compromise the walls integrity. There was a previous waterproofing company that had done work prior but the system failed.

disconnected the water hose from water supply
which caused the water to leak. Water was leaking
and the customer states it damaged the floor and

said would not leak. Additionally, the insured said
he would not leave it leaking if he saw it was
leaking. Insured stated it could be possible the
